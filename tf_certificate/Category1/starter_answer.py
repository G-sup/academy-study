# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this exam with increasing difficulty from 1-5.
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score significantly
# less than your Category 5 question.
#
# Don't use lambda layers in your model.
# You do not need them to solve the question.
# Lambda layers are not supported by the grading infrastructure.
#
# You must use the Submit and Test model button to submit your model
# at least once in this category before you finally submit your exam,
# otherwise you will score zero for this category.

# Getting Started Question
#
# Given this data, train a neural network to match the xs to the ys
# So that a predictor for a new value of X will give a float value
# very close to the desired answer
# i.e. model.predict([10.0] would give a satisfactory result
# The test infrastructure expects a trained model that accepts
# an input shape of [1]

# Note that you'll need to save your model as a .h5 like this.
# When you press the Submit and Test button, your saved .h5 model will
# be sent to the testing infrastructure for scoring
# and the score will be returned to you.
